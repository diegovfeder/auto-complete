# Autocomplete Component Challenge 🚀

Hello! I'm Diego Feder, and this is my submission for the front-end coding challenge for Deel. This project includes a React-based autocomplete component developed using Bun as the JavaScript runtime.

## Features 🌟

- React with TypeScript: Ensures type safety and developer productivity.
- No Third-party Libraries: Pure React implementation for autocomplete functionality.
- Asynchronous Data Handling: Mimics fetching data from an API.
- CSS Styling: Basic yet functional styling for the autocomplete component.
- Highlight Matching Text: Enhances user experience by highlighting parts of the suggestions that match the input query.

## Prerequisites 📋

Before you run this project, ensure you have Bun installed on your machine. Bun is used for running and building the application and provides faster performance compared to traditional JavaScript runtimes.

### How to Run the Project 🏃

1. Install Dependencies and Start the Application:

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

Navigate to <http://localhost:5173/> in your browser to see the application in action.

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
bun dev # Starts the Vite development server.
bun run build # Compiles and bundles the React application for production deployment.
bun preview #Serves the built application for preview before deployment.
```

## 📦 What's Inside?

This project includes:

- React 18: Utilizes the latest React features like hooks.
- TypeScript: For strong typing and reducing runtime errors.
- Vite: A modern build tool that significantly improves the developer experience.

## Development Notes 📝

Bun as a Runtime: Bun was chosen over other tools like Webpack or CRA due to its speed and efficiency in JavaScript execution.
